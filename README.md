## Purpose?

**Text1** is a new way of dealing with user data in React Native and React web apps.

It's optimized for building **complex applications** in React Native, and the number one goal is **real-world performance**. In simple words, _your app must launch fast_.

For simple apps, using Redux or MobX with a persistence adapter is the easiest way to go. But when you start scaling to thousands or tens of thousands of database records, your app will now be slow to launch (especially on slower Android devices). Loading a full database into JavaScript is expensive!

sadasds fixes it **by being lazy**. s simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)  will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.


## Usage

**Create blog posts:** an app with posts and comments.</br>
**See your blog posts** an app with posts and comments.</br>
**Save blog drafts:** an app with posts and comments.</br>
**Signup user:** an app with posts and comments.</br>
**Authenticate user:** an app with posts and comments.</br>

First, you define Models:

```js
class Post extends Model {
  @field('name') name
  @field('body') body
  @children('comments') comments
}

class Comment extends Model {
  @field('body') body
  @field('author') author
}
```

```js
const Comment = ({ comment }) => (
  <View style={styles.commentBox}>
    <Text>{comment.body} ‚Äî by {comment.author}</Text>
  </View>
)

// This is how you make your app reactive! ‚ú®
const enhance = withObservables(['comment'], ({ comment }) => ({
  comment: comment.observe()
}))
const EnhancedComment = enhance(Comment)
```

And now you can render the whole Post:

```js
const Post = ({ post, comments }) => (
  <View>
    <Text>{post.name}</Text>
    <Text>Comments:</Text>
    {comments.map(comment =>
      <Comment key={comment.id} comment={comment} />
    )}
  </View>
)

const enhance = withObservables(['post'], ({ post }) => ({
  post,
  comments: post.comments
}))
```
**Prisma üõÜ**

The result is fully reactive! Whenever a post or comment is added, changed, or removed, the right components **will automatically re-render** on screen. Doesn't matter if a change occurred in a totally different part of the app, it all just works out of the box!
